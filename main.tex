\begin{abstract}
    The Proto-Quipper language allows for high-level specification
    of quantum algorithms in a functional paradigm similar to Haskell.
    So far, the execution of Proto-Quipper programs has been confined
    to its own custom simulator (written in Haskell),
    with no ability to run on third-party
    simulators or real quantum hardware.
    This paper discusses efforts to integrate third-party locally-run
    simulators such as those developed by Google (Cirq) and IBM (Qiskit),
    as well as possible future efforts to enable execution of
    Proto-Quipper programs on cloud simulators and even 
    real quantum processing units (QPUs).
    We start by describing the technical requirements of Proto-Quipper
    program simulation,
    as well as the differences from other quantum programming
    paradigms that make interoperability between Proto-Quipper and
    rest of the quantum ecosystem difficult.
    We then explain our specific implementation of a new simulator
    architecture that allows for Proto-Quipper programs to be run
    on third-party simulators, and benchmark our implementation
    against the existing Haskell-based simulator on several
    quantum computing tasks.
    Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of our approach and how future
    work can overcome these, including the current lack of ability to
    run Proto-Quipper programs on currently available QPUs.
